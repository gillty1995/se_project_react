**Intro**

"WTWR" is an app created to report your local weather and recommend clothing that is appropriate for the day.

**Back-End**

Here is a link to the back-end server. https://github.com/gillty1995/se_project_express

**Technology**

This project is created using React.js, JSX, js, html, css, and the use of OpenWeather API. A mock server is set up using "json-server --watch db.json --id _id --port 3001".

**Final Thoughts**

UI runs smoothly with the new api, and the profile route is set up but can use updates. I would've liked to add a delete confirmation modal but ran out of time.
